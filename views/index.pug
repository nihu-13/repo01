      | Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their
      | society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge,
      | values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could
      | be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
      | Kingdom.
